# RVP-Test-Builds
## Introduction
RVP is a mispelled acronym of a game idea which I refer to as "Reverse Vampire Survivors" but the right definition of it would be is : "It is a  cookie clicker rogue-like". This repo contains the test builds and proof of concepts before I go into production with my game.

Builds in V0.01 branch are all abstraction builds meant to explore the systems and features which might make it to the prototype later.

## Note
Check branches for builds and their details.
