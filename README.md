# RVP-Test-Builds
## Introduction
RVP is a mispelled acronym of a game idea which I refer to as "Reverse Vampire Survivors" but the right definition of it would be is : "A Radial Bullet Hell". This repo contains the test builds, proof of concepts and Showcase Build for my thesis project.

Builds in V0.01 branch are all abstraction builds meant to explore the systems and features which might make it to the prototype later.

## Note
Check branches for builds and their details.

This repo was set up during the time when I wasn't too familiar with setting up Git Releases and I continued using this instead of doing releases.
