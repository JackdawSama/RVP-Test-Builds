# RVP-Test-Builds
## Introduction
RVP is a mispelled acronym of a game idea which I refer to as "Reverse Vampire Survivors". This is a gameplay test build and is an exploration of a vision which I have detailed below.

## Vision
For the gameplay I imagined a "Hero" character(Pink Square) to be swarmed by a lot of units(Dull Pink Circles) from all sides. I imagined this to be like a football player running through an endless football field covering yards while auto-attacking the defenders who come at him. 
The defenders who charge at the "Hero" are also capable of firing a controllable projectile that they can use the cursor to make it follow a path. The projectile shot by the unit gets destroyed if it hits a fellow unit or in the case of the hero deals damage and then gets destroyed.
With more time the screen becomes crowded with a lot of units and it necessary that the player uses the curving ability to successfully navigate their projectile to hit the hero.
Every time a defender dies, the player assumes control of a new defender(this is indicated by a White Circle) and continues to chip away at the "hero".
If the defender is hit by the hero's projectile or comes in contact with the hero, they're are destroyed.

### Known Bugs
The player assumes control of more than one unit at a time. This at times causes the player to switch units even before their unit in focus dies due to another non-focused unit(buggy unit) either colliding with the hero or the hero's projectile.
